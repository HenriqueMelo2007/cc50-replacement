# CC5O REPLACEMENT

In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (that is, reversibly hide) a message by replacing each letter with another. To do this, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the corresponding letter when encrypted. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so they could reverse the process: translating the encrypted text (usually called ciphertext) back into the original message (usually called plaintext).

A key, for example, could be the sequence NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB. This 26-character key means that A (the first letter of the alphabet) must be converted to N (the first character of the key), B (the second letter of the alphabet) must be converted to Q (the second character of the key), and so on.

A message like HELLO would then be encrypted as FOLLE, replacing each of the letters according to the mapping determined by the key.
